              <h3>What to expect</h3>
                <p>Work. Therapy is work, and sometimes is not fun (although sometimes it really is!) Things might get worse for a
                while in therapy, as difficult issues are explored and emotions are released. Some sessions may leave you
                feeling emotionally drained. Sometimes change and results can be dramatic and quick, and other times it may
                go in fits and starts, or painfully slowly. My office is a safe place for exploring your issues, and I also stress that
                you use healthy ways to take good care of yourself in the many hours outside of therapy.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
              <h3>Your Job</h3>
              <p>As a client you need to show up and do your homework. You are in therapy for only one hour out of 168 hours
                of the week. And I have no control over what you do when you walk out the door. So the changes often take
                place out of my office, when you experiment and try new things. Your job is to try, to stretch, to think, to process,

                to be curious about yourself, and to be a little bit brave. In essence, you have to work at your therapy. The more
                you put into your therapy, the more you will get out of it. Let me be clear. I cannot change you, but I can be with
                you as your consultant and cheerleader as you make needed changes. As a result, I cannot take the credit for
                the success you have in therapy. You own that. </p>

              <h3>Ending Therapy</h3>
              <p>Therapists have a strange job! My husband has commented that therapists are the only people he knows
                  whose job is to put themselves out of a job. You will begin therapy once a week, preferably. I find that any less
                  than that is difficult because you will forget to do your homework and we will spend much of the session catching
                  up. Some clients who have complicated trauma may need to attend even more frequently, for a time. But when
                  we begin to “talk about movies” and your goals have been reached, you and I will talk and usually agree to
                  space out our sessions and gradually terminate. But my door is always open even after a client is discharged if
                  there is a need to reenter therapy.</p>
