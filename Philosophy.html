    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>When I was eleven I announced that I wanted to be a psychiatrist. Although my life took a very different path for
    a number of years, I found myself drawn back to that early fascination with how the mind works and the desire to
    help others. So I changed career paths and became a counselor. I have never regretted it and I cannot imagine
    doing anything else. It is incredibly rewarding. My clients continue to teach me so much and astound me with
    their bravery and insights.</p>
    <p>I am recovered from growing up in a dysfunctional family. I am an adult child of an alcoholic and a child of
    divorced parents. I have recovered from an eating disorder, and from the trauma of a car accident and the death
    of a husband. So I know firsthand that a person is able to stretch and do what seems impossible-to heal and to
    learn and grow from the tragedies and issues in our lives. I have had my own counseling (never go to a
    counselor who has not!) and so I know that counseling can really help, if we are open to trying new things.</p>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Work. Therapy is work, and sometimes is not fun (although sometimes it really is!) Things might get worse for a
    while in therapy, as difficult issues are explored and emotions are released. Some sessions may leave you
    feeling emotionally drained. Sometimes change and results can be dramatic and quick, and other times it may
    go in fits and starts, or painfully slowly. My office is a safe place for exploring your issues, and I also stress that
    you use healthy ways to take good care of yourself in the many hours outside of therapy.</p>

    <h2>Your job</h2>
    <p>As a client you need to show up and do your homework. You are in therapy for only one hour out of 168 hours
    of the week. And I have no control over what you do when you walk out the door. So the changes often take
    place out of my office, when you experiment and try new things. Your job is to try, to stretch, to think, to process,
    to be curious about yourself, and to be a little bit brave. In essence, you have to work at your therapy. The more
    you put into your therapy, the more you will get out of it. Let me be clear. I cannot change you, but I can be with
    you as your consultant and cheerleader as you make needed changes. As a result, I cannot take the credit for
    the success you have in therapy. You own that.</p>

    <h2>Ending therapy</h2>
    <p>Therapists have a strange job! My husband has commented that therapists are the only people he knows
    whose job is to put themselves out of a job. You will begin therapy once a week, preferably. I find that any less
    than that is difficult because you will forget to do your homework and we will spend much of the session catching
    up. Some clients who have complicated trauma may need to attend even more frequently, for a time. But when
    we begin to “talk about movies” and your goals have been reached, you and I will talk and usually agree to
    space out our sessions and gradually terminate. But my door is always open even after a client is discharged if
    there is a need to reenter therapy.</p>
