          <p>When I was eleven I announced that I wanted to be a psychiatrist. Although my life took a very different path for
              a number of years, I found myself drawn back to that early fascination with how the mind works and the desire to
              help others. So I changed career paths and became a counselor. I have never regretted it and I cannot imagine
              doing anything else. It is incredibly rewarding. My clients continue to teach me so much and astound me with
              their bravery and insights.</p>
              
          <p>I am recovered from growing up in a dysfunctional family. I am an adult child of an alcoholic and a child of
              divorced parents. I have recovered from an eating disorder, and from the trauma of a car accident and the death
              of a husband. So I know firsthand that a person is able to stretch and do what seems impossible-to heal and to
              learn and grow from the tragedies and issues in our lives. I have had my own counseling (never go to a
              counselor who has not!) and so I know that counseling can really help, if we are open to trying new things.

           <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
           <p>I believe that my job is to give my clients options: new ways to approach their issues, new perspectives, new
              tools, new knowledge, new ways to process trauma. And I try to do it with kindness, humor and respect.
              Because who doesn't want that?
              I am fascinated by the amazing ability of the human spirit to grow and change. In my practice, I do everything I
              can to facilitate the growth and change that my clients desire.
